# re-unpacker

## Purpose
Help a defender determine whether a sample appears packed/obfuscated and, if so, produce a **safe, repeatable unpacking plan** (static-first, optional dynamic only in a controlled sandbox) to recover a higher-fidelity artifact (e.g., dumped PE section(s) / unpacked executable) for downstream analysis and detection.

This skill is designed for **incident response, malware triage, and reverse engineering** workflows.

## When to use
Use when you have:
- A suspicious PE/ELF/Mach-O that looks packed (few readable strings, anomalous sections, entropy spikes).
- A “known” malware family sample that’s heavily obfuscated and you need a cleaner artifact for strings/capa/yara.
- A sandbox run indicating in-memory unpacking/decryption prior to behavior.

## When NOT to use
- If you cannot run the sample safely (no sandbox/VM, no containment) and unpacking requires execution.
- If the request is to create/modify malware, evade detection, or otherwise enable wrongdoing.

## Inputs expected
Provide at least one of:
- **File metadata**: `file` output, hashes, size, compile timestamp (if present).
- **Static triage outputs**: section table (`objdump -h`/`lief`/`pefile`), imports (`objdump -x`, `peframe`), entropy results (if you have them), strings (ASCII/UTF-16), packer signatures (Detect It Easy/PEiD/peframe), capa output.
- **Dynamic/sandbox notes (optional)**: process tree, API calls, memory map, module loads, “RWX” allocations, unpacking/dump events, or EDR telemetry.

If you want the skill to guide evidence generation, say so and include your environment constraints (OS, tools available, whether you can run a VM/sandbox).

## Non‑negotiables (guardrails)
- **Defensive-only**: do not provide instructions intended to enable malware creation, stealth, or evasion.
- **No blind execution**: never instruct running unknown samples on a host system. If dynamic steps are necessary, require a **controlled sandbox/VM** and minimal-risk configuration.
- **Evidence-first**: claims about “packed”, “UPX”, “Themida”, etc. must be tied to provided evidence (tool output, section names, signatures, entropy, imports, runtime telemetry).
- **Do not invent artifacts**: if you did not see a dump/unpacked file, do not claim you produced one.
- **Command hygiene**: prefer small, single-purpose commands; avoid long one-liners that are likely to fail on quoting.
- **No evasion guidance**: do not suggest disabling EDR, bypassing sandbox controls, or tampering with instrumentation.

## Output requirements
Return:
1) **Packing assessment summary** (1–6 bullets) with cited evidence excerpts.
2) **Unpacking plan** (step-by-step) in priority order:
   - Static-only steps first
   - Dynamic/sandbox steps only if needed
3) **Unpacking report** (template filled with what we know), including:
   - hashes of original sample
   - artifacts produced (if any) + hashes + how they were produced
   - environment assumptions and safety notes
4) **Next-step recommendations** (what to do with the unpacked artifact: strings/capa/yara/IOC extraction)

### Confidence vocabulary
Use one of: `confirmed | high | medium | low | contextual`
- `confirmed`: direct tool output or direct observation (e.g., “UPX!” signature, a successful dump hash).
- `high/medium/low`: reasoned judgment with supporting evidence; note limitations.
- `contextual`: relevant but not diagnostic (e.g., suspicious filename).

## Codex compatibility notes (important)
Users may be running different Codex clients/versions. This skill must work under these constraints:

- If the environment **can run commands**, keep commands **small and reviewable**, and ask for approval before running installs.
- If the environment **cannot run commands** (or command execution is disabled), fall back to: “please run X locally and paste the output.”
- Do not assume slash commands exist. Prefer plain instructions like “run `codex --version` if available” rather than `/help`.

When available, gather:
- Codex client version: `codex --version` (if command exists)
- OS + shell: `uname -a` (or `ver` on Windows), and `echo $SHELL` if relevant

---

## Lean tool bootstrap (optional, but improves success)
This skill can **check for** and **suggest installing** a lean set of tools. It must:
- prefer OS package managers when possible
- avoid long one-liners
- never install anything without explicit user approval
- record tool presence/versions as evidence when provided
- Tool installation/checks are allowed (with approval), but **must never include running the suspicious sample** as part of installation validation.


### Minimal tool set (lean)
**Baseline (recommended):**
- `file`, `strings`, `objdump` (or `readelf`), `sha256sum`/`shasum`, `md5sum`/`md5`

**High-value optional (still lean):**
- `diec` (Detect It Easy command-line) for packer/signature hints
- `upx` for known UPX-packed samples (only use `upx -d` if evidence indicates UPX)
- `floss` for higher-quality strings extraction
- `capa` for before/after unpack comparison

> References: Detect It Easy provides `diec` CLI; capa and FLOSS are available as standalone releases and/or Python packages. citeturn0search3turn0search9turn0search6

### Step 0 — Tool check (safe)
Run (or ask the user to run) one check command:

**POSIX shells (Linux/macOS):**
- `command -v file strings objdump sha256sum shasum md5sum md5 upx diec floss capa yara || true`

**Windows (PowerShell):**
- `Get-Command file, strings, objdump, sha256sum, upx, diec, floss, capa, yara -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`

### Step 0b — Suggested installs (only if missing; user must approve)
Choose the smallest applicable path:

**Ubuntu/Debian (apt):**
- `sudo apt-get update`
- `sudo apt-get install -y file binutils coreutils upx-ucl yara`

**Fedora/RHEL-like (dnf):**
- `sudo dnf install -y file binutils coreutils upx yara`

**macOS (Homebrew):**
- `brew install file-formula binutils upx yara`

**Python-based tools (when OS packages aren’t available)**
Use one of:
- `python3 -m pip install --user flare-capa`  (capa) citeturn0search1turn0search5
- `python3 -m pip install --user flare-floss` (FLOSS) citeturn0search2turn0search6

**Windows (Chocolatey, if present):**
- `choco install -y die upx yara`
(If Chocolatey isn’t available, provide manual install guidance at a high level.)

> NOTE: FLOSS requires a newer Python; if Python is too old, prefer using the FLOSS standalone release instead of pip-installing. citeturn0search2

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Establish a safe baseline (always)
- Confirm you are working in a **non-production** environment.
- Identify the sample and compute hashes.

**Preferred evidence (paste outputs):**
- `sha256sum "<sample>" && sha1sum "<sample>" && md5sum "<sample>"`  
  (macOS: `shasum -a 256 "<sample>"` and `md5 "<sample>"`)
- `file "<sample>"`

### Step 2 — Static triage for packing indicators
Look for **multiple independent signals**:

**A) Strings**
- Very few readable strings or mostly garbage
- Short repetitive fragments
- Encrypted/config blobs without surrounding context

Commands (POSIX):
- `strings -a "<sample>" | head -n 200`
- `strings -el "<sample>" | head -n 200`  (UTF-16)
Optional (if installed):
- `floss "<sample>" | head -n 200`

**B) Sections**
- Unusual section names (random-looking, single huge section, missing typical sections)
- Very small import table, tiny `.text`, huge `.data`/custom section
- High entropy sections (if available)

Commands:
- `objdump -h "<sample>" | head -n 200`
- `objdump -x "<sample>" | head -n 260`

**C) Imports & loader behavior hints**
- Minimal imports; heavy reliance on `LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress` (Windows) or `dlsym` (Linux)
- Presence of anti-debug/anti-VM APIs (contextual, not definitive)

**D) Signature tooling (optional, lean)**
If installed:
- `diec "<sample>"` (or `diec -j "<sample>"` if JSON is supported in your build)
- `capa "<sample>"` (or `capa -j "<sample>"` if using JSON output)

### Step 3 — Decide the unpacking approach (static-first)
#### 3.1 If it looks like a known packer with a clean static unpack path
Example: UPX, some self-extracting formats.

- Prefer **vendor/official unpack tool** or well-known offline unpack method.
- Validate success by comparing:
  - section structure changes
  - strings increase
  - imports become more realistic
  - hashes change (expected)

**UPX case (only if evidence supports UPX)**
- Attempt: `upx -d "<sample>" -o "<sample>.unpacked"`
- Validate with Step 2 commands again on `<sample>.unpacked`.

#### 3.2 If static unpack is not feasible → dynamic/sandbox-only path (engineer decision required)

**PAUSE (execution gate):**
Dynamic unpacking requires executing the sample. I will not proceed automatically.

To continue, the engineer must explicitly approve:
- execution in an isolated VM/sandbox (revertible snapshot)
- networking posture (host-only / controlled egress)
- logging/telemetry to capture (process, file, registry, memory events)
- where artifacts will be stored and how they will be hashed

Once approved, paste the sandbox outputs/telemetry here and I will:
- identify the most likely “stub → payload” transition point from evidence
- recommend *high-level* dump/extraction options supported by your tooling
- validate unpacking success using static comparisons (strings/imports/capa deltas)

### Engineer approval prompt (required before execution)
If execution is needed, respond with:

> **PAUSE:** Unpacking now requires executing the sample.  
> Engineer: approve/deny running in sandbox. If approved, confirm VM snapshot exists, network posture, and what monitoring tools/logs you will capture.  
> Then paste the outputs (process tree, events, memory/dump indicators) and I will proceed with an evidence-driven unpacking plan.


**Dynamic signals to look for (evidence-based):**
- RWX allocations + execution
- decrypted code pages
- jump/transfer from stub to new region
- injection/hollowing indicators (Windows)


**Dynamic steps (high level, defensive)**
- Run in sandbox with monitoring enabled.
- Identify when the sample transitions from stub → payload.
- Dump memory region(s) containing the payload **only if your tooling supports it safely**.
- Extract dumped PE and validate with offline tooling.

### Step 4 — Validate unpacking success (evidence-driven)
Success criteria (at least two):
- Readable strings meaningfully increase (and look semantically relevant).
- Import table becomes richer/more realistic.
- capa hits become more specific / higher coverage.
- Decompression/decryption artifacts observed and dumped.

### Step 5 — Produce artifacts + document provenance
If you produced an unpacked/dumped artifact, capture:
- where it came from (file path, memory dump details, tool output)
- hashes
- how to reproduce

## Unpacking report format (what I will output)

### Packing assessment
- **Verdict**: packed/likely packed/unclear
- **Confidence**: <value>
- **Why (verbatim evidence excerpts)**:
  - <excerpt 1>
  - <excerpt 2>

### Unpacking plan (prioritized)
1. <static step> (expected outcome, validation check)
2. <static step> ...
3. <dynamic step (sandbox only)> ...

### Artifacts
- **Original sample**
  - sha256: ...
  - sha1: ...
  - md5: ...
  - notes: ...
- **Unpacked/dumped artifacts (if any)**
  - path: ...
  - sha256: ...
  - provenance: ...
  - validation: ...

### Next steps
- Run `re-ioc-extraction` on strings/logs from the unpacked artifact.
- Run capa/yara on unpacked artifact and compare deltas vs original.
- Extract config (if present) using static methods where possible.

## Definition of done
- A defensible packing assessment with verbatim evidence excerpts.
- A prioritized unpacking plan that respects safety constraints.
- If an unpacked artifact exists: hashes + provenance + validation notes.
- Clear next steps for downstream defensive analysis.
