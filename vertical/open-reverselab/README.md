Open-source reverse engineering lab — 183-article knowledge base, 100+ MCP automation tools, covering CTF pentesting / APK reverse engineering / PE binary analysis / cryptography & protocol cracking / game cheating analysis. Agent-native, directory-as-convention.

## Routing

```
Signal → kb_router(board=) → kb_read_file → Attack chain → MCP tool mapping → Execution
```

| Signal Type | Board | KB Categories / Files | MCP Tool Family |
|---|---|---|---|
| HTTP/Web/API/CVE/Cloud/CAPTCHA | `ctf-website` | 26/118 | `http_probe` `run_ctf_tool` `kb_router` |
| APK/DEX/SO/Frida/Java | `apk-reverse` | 8/20 | `android_app_baseline` `android_crypto_unpack_recipe` `android_frida_*` |
| PE/x64/x86/malware/driver | `pe-reverse` | 9/22 | `triage_pe` `ghidra_headless_analyze` `make_x64dbg_breakpoint_script` `sample_full_workup` |
| Crypto/Protocol/Cheat/IoT/Radio | `general` | 5/17 | `die_scan` `ghidra_*` `rizin_*` `python_re_tool_*` |

## Knowledge Base

```
kb/
├── ctf-website/techniques/   26 categories, 118 articles — Full web attack surface
├── apk-reverse/techniques/    8 categories, 23 articles — APK/DEX reverse engineering
├── pe-reverse/techniques/     9 categories, 24 articles — PE binary analysis
└── general/techniques/        5 categories, 17 articles — Cryptography / Protocols / Kernel / Cheating / Methodology
```

Each technique file follows this structure: `Scenario → Input signal → Method → Attack chain → MCP tool mapping`

Agent workflow: detect signal → `kb_router` lookup → `kb_read_file` → execute via MCP tool mapping.

## Boards

| Board | Trigger Signals |
|---|---|
| `boards/ctf-website` | URL, HTTP, JWT, SQLi, SSRF, CVE, API, CSP, OAuth, CAPTCHA, Cloudflare, ReDoS, Slowloris, DoS, Paywall |
| `boards/android` | APK, DEX, adb, Frida, jadx, smali, SO, native |
| `boards/windows` | PE, EXE, DLL, x64dbg, Ghidra, Procmon, packer, malware |
| `boards/general` | AES/DES/RSA, protobuf, game cheat, EAC/BE/Vanguard, firmware, JTAG, SDR |
| `boards/misc` | MCP config, skill installation, environment health check |

```

## Installation

On Windows, beginners can double-click `START_HERE.bat` or `START_HERE.cmd`
from the repository root. It checks Python, uv, Git, workspace layout, and
`reverse_lab_tools` MCP; creates core wrappers; runs real MCP tool calls; gives
install advice for missing items; and writes `reports/misc/first-run-report.json`
plus `reports/misc/mcp-smoke-report.json`.

On macOS/Linux, run `./START_HERE.sh` from the repository root. It performs the
same first-run checks and uses POSIX shell wrappers under `tools/bin/`; optional
Windows GUI/PE tools are skipped or reported as Windows-only. Platform-specific
release artifacts can stay separate: Windows full-toolchain releases ship
`.bat`/PowerShell and GUI tools, while macOS/Linux releases ship the Python,
MCP, shell-wrapper, and native CLI paths.

To have an AI Agent perform setup for you, copy the [AI install prompt](templates/prompts/ai-install.en.md) into Codex or Claude Code.
If you are not sure where to start, open [START.md](START.md).

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/LING71671/open-reverselab.git
cd open-reverselab
python scripts/misc/first_run_check.py       # Check workspace + reverse_lab_tools MCP
uv run --project tools/skills/mcp/ReverseLabToolsMCP python scripts/misc/mcp_smoke_check.py --write-report
.\scripts\misc\bootstrap.ps1              # Core script wrappers (no downloads)
.\scripts\misc\install_tools.ps1 -CTF       # Web tools
.\scripts\misc\install_tools.ps1 -Android   # APK tools
.\scripts\misc\install_tools.ps1 -Windows   # PE tools
.\scripts\misc\install_tools.ps1 -Common    # Ghidra + Maven
```

> **Windows Defender / antivirus note**: after installing the CTF / ExploitDB toolchains,
> Windows Security may flag vulnerability samples and payload documents, e.g.
> `tools/ctf-website/exploitdb`,
> `kb/ctf-website/techniques/24-database/03-nosql-injection.md`, `docs/llms-full.txt`.
> These files contain security-test payloads, webshells, shellcode, or ExploitDB samples
> and are expected content. Prefer a **minimal exclusion** over excluding the whole
> repository, e.g.:
>
> ```powershell
> Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "D:\open-reverselab\tools\ctf-website\exploitdb"
> ```
>
> If a specific document is also blocked, exclude just that file
> (`Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath <file-path>`).

macOS/Linux quick start:

```sh
./START_HERE.sh
./scripts/misc/bootstrap.sh
export PATH="$PWD/tools/bin:$PWD/tools/ctf-website/bin:$PATH"
python scripts/misc/ai_toolcheck.py --board misc
```

## Agent Quick Start

1. Clone into a stable local directory, for example `<workspace>/open-reverselab`.
2. Windows: double-click `START_HERE.bat` or `START_HERE.cmd` for the first-run check. macOS/Linux: run `./START_HERE.sh`.
3. Claude Code: `cd <workspace>/open-reverselab` before starting the session.
4. Codex APP: open the existing `open-reverselab` folder directly.
5. AI-assisted setup: copy [templates/prompts/ai-install.en.md](templates/prompts/ai-install.en.md) into your AI Agent.
6. Create a task: `python scripts/misc/new_task.py --board ctf-website --name <name>`.
7. After moving machines or changing MCP settings, confirm MCP tool calls pass. On Windows you can run the short entry `.\scripts\misc\check_mcp.ps1`; the equivalent full command (also for macOS/Linux) is `uv run --project tools/skills/mcp/ReverseLabToolsMCP python scripts/misc/mcp_smoke_check.py --write-report`.

Post-install verification:

```powershell
python scripts/misc/lab_healthcheck.py
python scripts/misc/ai_toolcheck.py --board misc
python scripts/misc/public_release_check.py
```

`--board misc` verifies the fresh-clone core Agent scripts and lightweight tools. Run the full `python scripts/misc/ai_toolcheck.py` only after installing the Android, Windows, and CTF board toolchains you need.

## Environment Snapshot (auto-probed on first use)

When you first open this project with an AI agent, the agent follows the
[Environment Snapshot Protocol in AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): it probes this machine
(OS, dev toolchain, reverse-engineering tools, Python RE libs, devices, sanitized
env vars, network, workspace) and writes the result to
`~/.open-reverselab/env/env.md` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.open-reverselab\env\env.md`).

The snapshot is machine-level and **shared across projects**: on every new session /
new folder the agent reads it directly, and only re-probes when it is older than
7 days or the protocol version changed. The snapshot stays on your machine under the
agreed path — never committed to the repo; env vars are sanitized per the protocol
(secret-like names are marked "set (masked)", proxy URLs have userinfo stripped).

## Context Chain

On startup the Agent loads context along this chain:

```
CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md → AI-USAGE.md → boards/<board>/AI-USAGE.md
```

Pair with [codex-session-patcher](https://github.com/ryfineZ/codex-session-patcher) for one-click project-level `.codex/` environment and MCP server configuration.
